# Mafia Game - iOS Edition

### Welcome to the **Mafia Game** â€“ a digital adaptation of the popular card-based party game, now available for iOS! Gather your friends and experience the suspense, mystery, and strategy of Mafia in a whole new way.

## ðŸ“– About the Game

The Mafia Game is a multiplayer social deduction game where players are divided into two teams: **Mafia** and **Villagers**. The goal is to eliminate the opposing team through strategy, deception, and teamwork.

The game begins with players receiving their roles secretly, followed by alternating rounds of day and night. During the night, the Mafia secretly chooses a player to eliminate, while during the day, everyone debates and votes to eliminate someone they believe is in the Mafia. The game continues until one team wins.

This iOS version offers a seamless and fun way to enjoy the game without the need for physical cards or manual tracking!
